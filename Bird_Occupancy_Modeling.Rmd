# Introduction
## NEON Birds
The U.S National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network is a continental-scale observation facility designed to collect long-term ecological data. 
The data product being used contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's breeding landbird sampling. 

Protocols: https://data.neonscience.org/documents/10179/1883155/NEON.DOC.014041vL/2a13bc2b-84db-e4e5-1d33-af8fac1f9e24

## Occupancy Modeling
Occupancy models are used to help estimate true occupancy of a species and can help account for imperfect detection of organisms in a study. 

# Setup
## Importing libraries
```{r}
library(neonUtilities) #package for downloading NEON data 
library(RPresence) # library for doing occupancy modelling
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2) # library for visualization
```

## Importing Data
```{r}
large_sites <- c(
  "BARR", "BART", "BONA", "CLBJ", "CPER", "DEJU", "DSNY", "GRSM",
  "GUAN", "HARV", "HEAL", "JERC", "JORN", "KONZ", "MLBS", "MOAB",
  "NIWO", "OAES", "ONAQ", "ORNL", "OSBS", "RMNP", "SJER", "SRER",
  "STEI", "TALL", "TEAK", "UKFS", "UNDE", "WOOD", "WREF", "YELL"
)
small_sites <- c(
  "DELA", "LENO", "TOOL", "SOAP", "STER", "PUUM", "KONA",
  "SERC", "DCFS", "NOGP", "LAJA", "BLAN", "SCBI", "ABBY", "TREE"
)
sites <- c(large_sites, small_sites)

if (!dir.exists("data")) {
  dir.create("data")
}

if (!dir.exists("outputs")) {
  dir.create("outputs")
}

if (file.exists("data/bird_counts.RData")) {
  load("data/bird_counts.RData")
} else {
  
  bird.counts <- loadByProduct(dpID="DP1.10003.001",
                               site=sites,
                               startdate="2018-01",
                               enddate="2023-12",
                               check.size = F)
  
  save(bird.counts, file = "data/bird_counts.RData")
}
```

## Data Examination

Describe how the data are set up (i.e., there are two tables, with what data in them?)

```{r}

```


## Data Cleanup

First, we need to do some generic data cleanup.

1. We need to filter out surveys that could not be completed for whatever reason (Covid, site was flooded, etc.)

```{r}
brd_perpoint_cleaned <- bird.counts$brd_perpoint %>%
  filter(samplingImpractical == "OK")
```

2. Since we're really only interested in species level data, we need to remove records that are not recorded to the species level

```{r}
brd_countdata_cleaned <- bird.counts$brd_countdata %>%
  filter(taxonRank == "species")
```

3. Add year as a column in each of these tables in order to join them correctly

```{r}
brd_perpoint_cleaned <- brd_perpoint_cleaned %>%
  mutate(year = str_extract(eventID, "\\d{4}"))

brd_countdata_cleaned <- brd_countdata_cleaned %>%
  mutate(year = str_extract(eventID, "\\d{4}"))
```


## Data Standardization

Because there is inconsistent sampling across sites (i.e., some sites are larger than others and not all plots within a site were continuously sampled over time), in order to do analyses across sites, we need to make sure that the data are standardized with respect to amount of sampling time.

```{r}

```

# Descriptive Analyses

Great, now that our data are cleaned and standardized, we can start doing some basic analyses. First, lets take a look at a single species within a site in terms of its detection and occupancy. 

## Within a site

melanerpes carolinus, SCBI


### Occupancy within a site

#### Data Munging (Create the occupancy table and covariants)

```{r}
# Filter the tables by site and species
brd_perpoint_model1 <- brd_perpoint_cleaned %>%
  filter(siteID %in% c("SCBI", "BARR", "BART", "BONA", "CLBJ", "CPER", "DEJU", "DSNY", "GRSM",
  "GUAN", "HARV", "HEAL", "JERC", "JORN", "KONZ", "MLBS", "MOAB"))

brd_countdata_model1 <- brd_countdata_cleaned %>%
  filter(siteID %in% c("SCBI", "BARR", "BART", "BONA", "CLBJ", "CPER", "DEJU", "DSNY", "GRSM",
  "GUAN", "HARV", "HEAL", "JERC", "JORN", "KONZ", "MLBS", "MOAB")) %>%
  filter(scientificName == "Melanerpes carolinus")

# Create keys for each table so we can join them into an occupancy table

brd_perpoint_model1 <- brd_perpoint_model1 %>%
  mutate(point_key = paste(namedLocation, pointID, boutNumber, sep = "_"))

brd_countdata_model1 <- brd_countdata_model1 %>%
  mutate(point_key = paste(namedLocation, pointID, boutNumber, sep = "_"))

# Step 1: Get valid siteID–year combinations (from perpoint)
valid_site_years <- brd_perpoint_model1 %>%
  distinct(plotID, year)

# Step 2: Filter brd_countdata to match valid point_keys
brd_joineddata_model1 <- semi_join(
  brd_countdata_model1,
  brd_perpoint_model1,
  by = "point_key"
)

# Step 3: Actual detections — only species *actually observed at a site*
detections <- brd_countdata_model1 %>%
  group_by(plotID, year) %>%
  summarize(present = 1, .groups = "drop")

# Step 4: Get species × siteID combinations
species_grid <- valid_site_years

# Step 5: Join detections and fill 0s
species_by_year_plot <- species_grid %>%
  left_join(detections, by = c("plotID", "year")) %>%
  mutate(present = replace_na(present, 0)) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = present
  )

View(species_by_year_plot)
```

#### Create the Pao presence-absence object (Pao)
```{r}
birds_pao_model1 <- createPao(
  data = species_by_year_plot[, c("2018", "2019", "2020", "2021", "2022", "2023")],
  unitnames = species_by_year_plot$plotID,
  title = "Red-bellied Woodpecker of SCBI"
)
```

#### Run the actual model
```{r}
birds_occupancy_model1 <- occMod(
  data = birds_pao_model1,           
  model = list(psi ~ 1,  p ~ SURVEY),
  type = 'so'
  )

str(birds_occupancy_model1)
```

#### Model Results
```{r}
summary(birds_occupancy_model1)
birds_occupancy_model1$real$psi
birds_occupancy_model1$real$p

ests <- as.data.frame(print_one_site_estimates(mod = birds_occupancy_model1))

ests <- ests %>% 
  mutate(parm = c("psi", "p1", "p2", "p3", "p4", "p5", "p6")) %>% 
  select(parm, est, se, lower, upper) %>% 
  rename(., 
    c(
      Parameter = parm,
      Estimate = est,
      SE = se,
      L95 = lower,
      U95 = upper
    )
  ) %>% 
  `rownames<-`(seq_len(nrow(ests))) %>%
  filter(Parameter != "psi")

ggplot(ests, aes(x = Parameter, y = Estimate)) +
  labs(x = "Parameter", y = "Estimate") +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = L95, ymax = U95), width = 0.2) +
  theme_bw()

```


### Detection within a site
```{r}

```



Ignore everything after this
----------------------------------------------------------------------


## Detection
### Detection by species
Something descriptive about setup and how we're rearranging the data
```{r Setup}
#the end of this should be a table with species (row) x year (cols)
counts <- bird.counts$brd_countdata
counts$year <- as.numeric(substr(counts$startDate, 1, 4)) 

# add year column
counts <- counts %>% 
          group_by(year)
View(counts)

# simplify to detection by year and species
counts_by_year <- counts %>%
  count(year, scientificName) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(scientificName))
View(counts_by_year)

# convert to wide format: species as rows, years as columns
wide_df <- counts_by_year %>% 
pivot_wider(
    id_cols = scientificName,       
    names_from = year, 
    values_from = n,
    values_fill = 0
  )

# View Resulting Table
View(wide_df)
```

Something descriptive about what it is we're doing
```{r Model}

```

something describing the outputs
```{r Outputs}

```

What do we see in the output? is this cool? What is it teling us? yay birds.

### Detection by species x site
